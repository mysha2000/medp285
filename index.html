      I believe anything that is customized and require the use of codes to publish online can be considered a creative web project

      How do each of you wish to employ the web or the internet as a creative platform?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I wish to use the internet as a way to communicate and customize information into something aesthically pleasing for people that are requesting as such. Kind of like working for a PR firm and being able to use the internet to help change or mend someones image.

    </h2>

      My goal is to become more comfortable creating web designs, where using different platforms shouldn't hinder my abilities to code.
